	abstract = {As nuclear power expands, technical, economic, political, and environmental analyses of nuclear fuel cycles by simulators increase in importance. To date, however, current tools are often fleet-based rather than discrete and restrictively licensed rather than open source. Each of these choices presents a challenge to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency, robustness, and scientific transparency. The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current capabilities of Cyclus are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel cycles.},

- Madison, is an open source platform for exploring the long-
term impact of alternative nuclear fuel cycles. The C YCLUS
core provides the infrastructure for an agent-based approach,
allowing user-provided modules to define the behavior of fuel
cycle facilities as they interact to exchange materials. An im-
portant consequence of this approach is that innovative facility
and material exchange concepts can be introduced to a consis-
tent framework allowing for more rigorous comparison. The
C YCLUS team has recently grown and now incorporates a vari-
ety of expertise: output visualization capability through collab-
oration with the University of Utah, server-client communica-
tion via the University of Idaho, input visualization and control
with the University of Texas - Austin, and social communica-
tion expertise through collaborators at UW-Madison to assist
the mission-critical goal of relevancy vis-{\`a}-vis policy makers.
Accordingly, the C YCLUS project is expanding efforts in the
realms of both structural capability and benchmarking calcula-
tions.
A series of once-through fuel cycle scenarios are being con-
ducted using the C YCLUS core and accompanying modules.
Where needed, additional modules have been added, includ-
ing a region model that intelligently makes building decisions
given a demand function. The results of these scenarios are
then compared with VISION [1] to provide a benchmark of
the C YCLUS results.},

	abstract = {The C YCLUS project at the University of Wisconsin - Madi-
son is the result of lessons learned from experience with pre-
vious nuclear fuel cycle simulation platforms. The modeling
paradigm follows the transacation of discrete quanta of ma-
terial among discrete facilities, arranged in a geographic and
institutional framework, and trading in flexible markets. Key
concepts in the design of C YCLUS include open access to the
simulation engine, modularity with regard to functionality, and
relevance to both scientific and policy analyses. The combina-
tion of modular encapsulation within the software architec-
ture and an open development paradigm allows for a bal-
ance between collaboration at multiple levels of simulation
detail and security of proprietary or sensitive data.
When comparing different nuclear fuel cycle concepts, it
can be a challenge to find any two systems analyses that com-
pare across a common set of metrics with a similar set of un-
derlying assumptions. Each analysis is likely to focus on a set
of metrics that are of interest to the team performing the analy-
sis and involve both implicit and explicit assumptions and con-
straints about the behavior of the fuel cycle system. While
a strict prescription of these metrics, assumptions and con-
straints could be proposed for comparison purposes, another
solution is to provide a systems analysis simulation tool that
provides sufficient modularity, extensibility and open access,
that it can be a basis for harmonzing to a common set. If it
becomes easier to modify an existing simulation tool to sup-
port the needs of a new analysis than it is to develop a new
tool, then it is possible that such a tool will be adopted more
universally for such analysis.},

	abstract = {Simulation of the nuclear fuel cycle is an established field with multiple players. Prior development work has utilized tech- niques such as system dynamics to provide a solution structure for the matching of supply and demand in these simulations. In general, however, simulation infrastructure development has occured in relatively closed circles, each effort having unique considerations as to the cases which are desired to be modeled. Accordingly, individual simulators tend to have their design decisions driven by specific use cases. Presented in this work is a proposed supply and demand matching algorithm that lever- ages the techniques of the well-studied field of mathematical programming. A generic approach is achieved by treating fa- cilities as individual entities and actors in the supply-demand market which denote preferences amongst commodities. Using such a framework allows for varying levels of interaction fi- delity, ranging from low-fidelity, quick solutions to high-fidelity solutions that model individual transactions (e.g. at the fuel- assembly level). The power of the technique is that it allows such flexibility while still treating the problem in a generic man- ner, encapsulating simulation engine design decisions in such a way that future simulation requirements can be relatively easily added when needed.},

The baseline design for this Mark-I PB-FHR (Mk1) plant is a 236-MW(thermal) reactor. The Mk1 uses a fluoride salt coolant with solid, coated-particle pebble fuel. The Mk1 design differs from earlier FHR designs because it uses a nuclear air-Brayton combined cycle designed to produce 100 MW(electric) of base-load electricity using a modified General Electric 7FB gas turbine. For peak electricity generation, the Mk1 has the ability to boost power output up to 242 MW(electric) using natural gas co-firing. The Mk1 uses direct heating of the power conversion fluid (air) with the primary coolant salt rather than using an intermediate coolant loop. By combining results from computational neutronics, thermal hydraulics, and pebble dynamics, UCB has developed a detailed design of the annular core and other key functional features. Both an active normal shutdown cooling system and a passive, natural-circulation-driven emergency decay heat removal system are included. Computational models of the FHR-validated using experimental data from the literature and from scaled thermal-hydraulic facilities-have led to a set of design criteria and system requirements for the Mk1 to operate safely and reliably. Three-dimensional, computer-aided-design models derived from the Mk1 design criteria are presented.},

collisions between the grains dissipate energy, and their macroscopic size renders thermal fluctuations negligible. When a mass of
grains is subjected to mechanical vibration, it can make a transition to a fluid state. In this state, granular matter exhibits patterns and
instabilities that resemble those of molecular fluids. Here, we report a granular solid{\textendash}liquid phase transition in a vibrating granular
monolayer. Unexpectedly, the transition is mediated by waves and is triggered by a negative compressibility, as for van der Waals
phase coexistence, although the system does not satisfy the hypotheses used to understand atomic systems. The dynamic behaviour
that we observe{\textemdash}coalescence, coagulation and wave propagation{\textemdash}is common to a wide class of phase transitions. We have combined

	abstract = {The theory of non-ideal gases in thermodynamic equilibrium, for instance the van der Waals gas model, has played a central role in the understanding of coexisting phases. Here, we report a combined experimental, numerical and theoretical study of a liquid-solid-like phase transition which takes place in a vertically vibrated fluidized granular monolayer. The first experimental setup is a long, narrow channel, with a width of the order of a few particle diameters, hence the dynamics is quasi-one-dimensional. We have considered this configuration to characterize the dynamic behavior of the phase transition. The second setup is used to measure the pressure as function of particle density in order to clarify the physical mechanism behind this phase transition. We demonstrate that the transition is mediated by waves and that it is triggered by a negative compressibility as in van der Waals phase coexistence, although the system does not satisfy the hypotheses used to understand atomic systems. Finally, in order to further characterize this phase transition, we study static and dynamic correlation functions, and bond-orientational order parameters.},

However, current nuclear fuel cycle simulators lack dynamic repository performance analysis due to the computational burden of high-fidelity hydrolgic contaminant transport models. The Cyder disposal environment and repository module was developed to fill this gap. It implements medium-fidelity hydrologic radionuclide transport models to support assessment appropriate for fuel cycle simulation in the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator.
Rapid modeling of hundreds of discrete waste packages in a geologic environment is enabled within this module by a suite of four closed form models for advective, dispersive, coupled, and idealized contaminant transport: a Degradation Rate model, a Mixed Cell model, a Lumped Parameter model, and a 1-D Permeable Porous Medium model. A summary of the Cyder module, its timestepping algorithm, and the mathematical models implemented within it are presented. Additionally, parametric demonstrations simulations performed with Cyder are presented and shown to demonstrate functional agreement with parametric simulations conducted in a standalone hydrologic transport model, the Clay Generic Disposal System Model developed by the Used Fuel Disposition Campaign Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy.},

	title = {Current {Status} of {Predictive} {Transition} {Capability} in {Fuel} {Cycle} {Simulation}},
	abstract = {Nuclear fuel cycle simulation scenarios are most naturally described as 
constrained objective functions. The objectives are often systemic 
demands such as ``achieve 1\% growth for total electricity production 
and reach 10\% uranium utilization''. The constraints take 
the form of nuclear fuel cycle technology availability 
(``reprocessing begins after 2025 and fast reactors first become 
available in 2050'').

To match the natural constrained objective form of the scenario 
definition, NFC simulators must bring demand responsive 
deployment decisions into the dynamics of the simulation logic.

In particular, a NFC simulator should have the 
capability to deploy supporting fuel cycle facilities to enable 
a demand to be met. Take, for instance, the standard once through fuel 
cycle. Reactors may be deployed to meet a objective power demand. 
However, new mines, mills, and enrichment facilities will also need to be 
deployed to ensure that reactors have sufficient fuel to produce power.  
In many simulators, the unrealistic solution to this problem is to 
simply have infinite capacity support facilities. Alternatively, 
detailing the deployment timeline of all facilities becomes the 
responsibility of the user.

The authors seek to identify the most flexible, general, and performant 
algorithms applicable to this modeling challenge.  Accordingly, a review was 
conducted of current NFC simulation tools to determine the 
current capabilites for demand-driven and transition scenarios. 
Additionally, the authors investigated promising algorithmic
innovations that have been successful for similar applications in other domains
such as economics and industrial engineering.},
