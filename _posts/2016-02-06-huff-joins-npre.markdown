I am thrilled to be joining the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as 
an Assistant Professor in the Department of Nuclear, Plasma and Radiological 
Engineering. I was honored to have been awarded a Blue Waters Assistant 
Professorship as well as an affiliate faculty appointment with the National 
Center for Supercomputing Applications. The support of NCSA is very meaningful 
to me and I hope to make important use of the high performance computing 
resources on campus when I arrive.

I will begin my appointment on August 16, 2016. Until then, I'll be wrapping up 
my work at the University of California, Berkeley. In addition, I'll be 
preparing my first NPRE course, seeking graduate students and postdocs for a 
research group, finding a home in the Urbana-Champaign area, and setting up 
this website.
