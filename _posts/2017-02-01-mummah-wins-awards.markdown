Senior ARFC undergraduate Kathryn Mummah, Katie for short, has recently received 
honors from the Roy G. Post Foundation as well as a Knights of St. Patrick. 

She is the University of Illinois' first recipient of a Roy G. Post Foundation 
undergraduate scholarship and has been invited to attend the Waste Management 
Symposium in Arizona, March 5-9, in order to receive her award.  

Similarly, when The Knights of St. Patrick of the University of Illinois 
announced their award recipients (by covertly decorating the Grainger Library 
with St. Patrick's Day ephemera), Katie was among the short list of 2017 
honorees. 

ARFC is lucky to have an accomplished group of students and we congratulate 
Katie on both of these awards which give, in their own way, special recognition 
of her outstanding record of service and academic performance.
