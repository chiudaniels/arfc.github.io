ARFC graduate student, **Jin Whan Bae**, Teddy for short, will be recognized this 
month with the **2017 Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering Outstanding 
Undergraduate Research Award.**  Teddy has been invited to attend the Department 
Honors and Awards Banquet on April 13th, where he will formally receive his 
award.  This recognition consists of a monetary award, a certificate, and a 
listing on a plaque that is permanently displayed in Talbot Laboratory.  

In Fall 2016, Teddy was an undergraduate researcher in ARFC. This semester he
is completing his undergraduate degree while beginning his first semester as a
graduate student in ARFC. 

He is being recognized for his significant achievements in research as an
undergraduate. In particular, in Fall 2016, Teddy led a project to quantify the
feasibility, benefits, and drawbacks of a creative disposal concept.  For this
work, Teddy consulted technically with Prof. Huff as well as key NPRE experts, 
Dr. William  Roy and Prof. Cliff Singer. This work culminated in a paper 
submission to the International High-Level Radioactive Waste Management 
Conference (IHLRWM2017).  This paper, "Benefits of Siting a Borehole Repository 
on Non-Operating Nuclear Facility," was exceptional work and was 
enthusiastically accepted.  Expert reviewers said about this paper "Wonderful 
paper! Publish basically as is." and "This is an excellent paper that maps out 
an entirely plausible new way to look at nuclear waste storage in the US." 

ARFC is lucky to have an accomplished group of students. We especially congratulate 
Teddy on this award as it recognizes a core value of our research group: 
exceptional scholarship.
