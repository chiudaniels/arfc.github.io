ARFC graduate student, **Jin Whan Bae**, Teddy for short, travelled to Seoul, 
South Korea in September to present a poster at the [GLOBAL 2017 Nuclear Fuel 
cycle Conference.](http://www.global2017.org/)

His poster, titled "Current Status of Predictive Transition Capability in Fuel 
Cycle Simulation," was accompanied by a conference paper of the same name. It 
established the state of the art of predictive fuel cycle facility deployment 
in exising nuclear fuel cycle simulators.

Bae said:

> "Thanks to ARFC, I was able to network with professionals and academics
> worldwide in my field. I think the experience and things I learned in the
> conference will help me greatly in my research and my career."
