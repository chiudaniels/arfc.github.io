All members of the research group are required to agree with the following code of
conduct. Additionally, we collectively agree to enforce this code. We are
expecting cooperation from all members to help ensuring a safe environment for
everyone.

## The Quick Version

This research group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free 
experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, 
age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, 
ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not 
tolerate harassment of group members or other colleagues in any form. Sexual 
language and imagery is not appropriate for any professional setting, including 
talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Research group 
members violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the group at 
the discretion of Kathryn Huff.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender 
identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical 
appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual 
images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, 
harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of the research 
environment, talks, or other events, inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome 
sexual attention, or creation of an otherwise sexualized environment.

Group members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply 
immediately.

If a member engages in harassing behavior, other group members and Kathryn Huff may 
take any action they deem appropriate to stop this behavior, including warning the offender or 
expulsion from the group and sactioning through official University of Illinois 
channels.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have 
any other concerns, please contact Katy Huff immediately.  Katy Huff is 
available to help group members contact security or local law enforcement, 
navigate official University reporting channels, or otherwise assist those 
experiencing harassment to feel safe in the research environment. 

If Katy is the cause of the concern or you would prefer she not be involved, 
official concerns can be addressed by contacting the 
[UIUC WeCare office](http://wecare.illinois.edu/), or the 
[Campus Office of Diversity, Equity and Access](http://www.diversity.illinois.edu/).

We expect research group members to follow these rules in all professional 
settings including the office, conferences, workshop venues, and group-related 
social events.  We additionally expect members to treat each other 
professionally with respect to their work and workspaces, with constructive 
criticism, without dismissive behavior, and without disruption of shared 
working spaces.
