It's up to you how you prefer to communicate with the rest of the group. 
Please remember that the [Code of Conduct](/manual/coc) applies in all of these 
channels.

## GitHub 

GitHub is where we store our code. So, it's also a place where we can discuss 
that code. We have a GitHub organization for the group at 
[github.com/arfc](https:github.com/arfc). More about using GitHub can be found 
in the in [the book](http://physics.codes).

### Issues

Create issues with lots of information about how to replicate the issue, what 
has been tried, etc. Use tags and milestones where possible. If you or someone 
else is going to start working on the issue immediately, assign the issue to that 
person.

As things move forward with the solution to an issue, continue to discuss 
progress on the issue itself. 

### Milestones

Milestones are groups of issues accompanied by a description and deadline. 
These will often be created for a code release, publication submission, or 
similarly multifaceted large goal.

### Gists

Sometimes, it's helpful to be able to communicate just a snippet of code. Gists 
are one way to do this: https://gist.github.com/ 

## Chatting

If you like synchronous communication, there are a couple of ways to chat with 
the group or members of the group without causing extra email traffic. You are 
not required to participate in synchronous communication.

### Slack

The ARFC group has an organizational account with [Slack](slack.com). To use 
Slack:

- Sign up for the group at [https://arfc.slack.com/signup](https://arfc.slack.com/signup) 
- You may need to use your illinois.edu account to sign up. 
- If you would prefer it to be associated with a different email address, sign 
  up with your illinois email and then once you're logged in and signed up for 
  the group, you can change your email address in the preferences panel.  
- There is a desktop application you can download.
- There are also native apps for both ios and android.

Feel free to add channels for anything related to the group. Feel free to use 
the random channel for fun, non-work stuff. 

### Google Hangout

The current preferred video-conferencing platform in the group is [Google 
Hangout](https://hangouts.google.com/). 

You can [add a google hangout to any google calendar 
event](https://support.google.com/a/answer/4362302?hl=en). This is encouraged 
if you plan to host the meeting virtually.

### Be careful

Note that both google hangouts and Slack may push notifications to your 
desktop. This can be distracting while you're trying to focus. It can also be 
embarassing if one of these notifications pops up in the middle of a public 
presentation, while you are broadcasting from your laptop. **When you don't 
want these notifications to pop up and interrupt, you can pause them.** Both 
apps have a setting for this.


## Email

Sign up for the [private ARFC 
listhost](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/arfc). This is where most 
announcements will appear.

## Twitter

ARFC is not on Twitter. Let me know if you think we should be.
For now, if you like Twitter, though, don't hesitate to follow :

- [https://twitter.com/katyhuff](@katyhuff)
- [https://twitter.com/illinoisNPRE](@illinoisNPRE)
- [https://twitter.com/NCSAatIllinois](@NCSAatIllinois)
- [https://twitter.com/EngineeringAtIL](@EngineeringAtIL)

## Blog

This website has a news section. Blog posts are strongly encouraged!  To post, 
add a markdown file to the `_posts` directory in the arfc/arfc.github.io source 
repository. Submit it as a pull request. You can follow the [RSS 
feed](https://arfc.github.io/feed.xml) if you use a feed reader. 

## Documents

Any research group is going to have a lot of documents. Ideally, they will be 
easily found by the members of the group who should have access. When in doubt, 
make documents as public as possible. We use the following places to edit and 
store documents.

### GitHub

Any documents related to software development should probably be in the 
documentation for the code itself, version controlled in GitHub. Similarly, 
manuscripts for publication should be developed on GitHub. 

### Guides

Permanent documents and records related to the operation of the research group 
might be appropriate for these guides, here on the website. To add or edit a 
guide, you will first need to have the website repository forked and cloned.

- fork the website repository
- clone your fork of the website repository

You'll also need to [have jekyll installed.](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) 

Once you have the repository cloned and jekyll is installed:

- `cd arfc.github.io`
- `git checkout source`
- `cd manual/guides`
- Add or edit the markdown file of your choice.
- Git add, git commit, and git push your changes to the source branch of your 
  fork.
- Check that it looks ok by running `jekyll serve`.
- In your browser, navigate to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) to see the site rendered.
- Once you're satisfied, press Ctrl-C to stop serving the site locally.
- Once it's all looking nice, make a pull request to the source branch of [arfc/arfc.github.io](https://github.com/arfc/arfc.github.io/).

### Wiki

There's also [a wiki for the ARFC 
group](https://wiki.cites.illinois.edu/wiki/display/ARFC/). If that seems like 
the appropriate place for a document then please use that.  You'll need to log 
in with your Illinois credentials. 

### Google Drive

Notes in meetings and other really simultaneous editing is probably easiest in 
Google Docs. We have a group Google Drive directory for information that should be 
shared and accessible to all group members. To use google drive 

- Learn about the Illinois Google Drive setup [here](https://answers.uillinois.edu/illinois/55050).
- Consider installing the [Google Drive desktop application](https://www.google.com/drive/download/) for ease of use. 
- Tell Katy what email address(es) to give read/write permission for the group 
  directory.
- Try to keep the ARFC directory tidy by categorizing new documents as logically as 
  possible.


## Calendar 

ARFC has a google calendar. It has various scholarship, fellowship, and grant 
deadlines that group members might want to be aware of. It also is a great 
place for group meetings, outings, deadlines, etc. To be added to the calendar:

- Have a google calendar account. All UIUC students and staff have one.
- Tell Katy what email address to use to add you to the calendar so you can create events and such.
- You should get an email alerting you that you have access.
- Once this has happened, go to [calendar.google.com](https://calendar.google.com). 
- The calendar should show up under "Other Calendars." If it doesn't:
- Click the down arrow next to Other Calendars. 
- Click "Add a friend's calendar"
- Put this email address in: v3ih5p16gub2a2q32t23pv4esc@group.calendar.google.com
