I look forward to speaking with you virtually or in person.

# When

If you are a student in my class, you should meet with me during my stated
office hours for that course.

For everyone else: here's a url where you can pick a time and place that works for you:
[katyhuff.youcanbook.me](http://katyhuff.youcanbook.me). It syncs with my
calendar. Once you've filled it out, we'll both receive an email that confirms
the details.

- If it's 5 minutes, try dropping by my office. 
- If it's 15 minutes, schedule me for a 15 minute meeting. 
- If it's 30 minutes, schedule me for a 30 minute meeting and come prepared.
- If it's longer than 30 minutes, are you sure?

# How

I look forward to meeting with you. I am always open to discuss new ideas with
colleagues, group members, students, and potential collaborators. My office
door is often open for this reason.  However, please be aware that I
think my office hours work most effectively if I arrive prepared. To get the
most out of your time with me:

- Send a concise written description of the topic or question (a couple of paragraphs by email) at least a day or two before meeting.
- If you are coming to me with a programming conundrum, please see this [guide](/manual/guides/katy/codereq) before setting up a meeting
- If you would like to discuss data or theory, I recommend bringing ample diagrams, figures, and tables to our meeting for discussion.
- Like other humans, I usually need advance time to review something. See this [guide](/manual/guides/katy/revreq) on that topic.
