# Listing me as a reference

I would prefer that you do not list me as a reference unless you have asked me
first whether I would be willing to support your application.

# Who I will write for

I am very happy to write a letter of reference for most people who:

- took at least one course from me
- worked in my research group
- collaborated with me or my research group
- or interacted with me in some other way relevant to the application

In all cases, I consider letter writing an exercise in integrity. I seek to be
simultaneously as honest and generous as possible. Given this, please use your
judgement, based on our past interactions, about whether I would be a good
reference. If you are unsure about what kind of letter I would write for
you, perhaps I am the wrong choice of reference.

# Asking

If you're ok with all of this, please write me a pleasant formal email indicating that you have read this
information:

- Please make your request well in advance (at least a few weeks) before it will be due.
- Please don't forget to [write a professional email](http://chrisblattman.com/2010/11/08/students-how-to-email-to-your-professor-employer-and-professional-peers/).

I'm going to need some information. Most importantly, if I don't see you on a 
daily basis, please remind me how we know one another. Please also provide:

- your up-to-date CV or resume,
- a list of where the letters will go,
- ideally with links to descriptions of those positions,
- and the due dates for the references.
- Will they call me or ask for a letter via email?
- Why do you think you are a good candidate?
- Are there any specific guidelines for the letter?

For grad school, scholarship, or academic job market applications, in 
particular, I could be helped by:

- Any relevant application material (e.g. research statement, teaching statement, statement of intent)
- A reminder about any particular feature of you or your work that you are 
  hoping I will address.
