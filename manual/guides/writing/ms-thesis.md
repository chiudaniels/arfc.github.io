## Rules of the MS Thesis

There are many rules. From the grad handbook:

> The thesis should be a creative work of potential use to the nuclear, plasma,
> and radiological engineering community. The scope should permit completion
> within a reasonable time frame. The thesis must be deposited with the Graduate
> College Thesis Office. Publication is encouraged.  

## Review Process

Enable chapter-by-chapter review of your thesis by your advisor.
When your advisor approves, share the thesis with your second reader.
Both the thesis advisor and the second reader should be given a month (two weeks minimum) with the document.

## After Writing

- Add yourself to the degree list.
- File your thesis with the graduate school. 
- Complete any other degree-related beurocracy.
