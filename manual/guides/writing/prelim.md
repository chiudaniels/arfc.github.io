## Rules of the Prelim

Universities and departments vary. UIUC NPRE has its rules written in the grad 
school handbook.

The prelim is like a contract between the student and the committee. It
establishes the scope of the PhD work to be accomplished. Recall that:

The goals and desired level of Ph.D. dissertation research are:

a. A dissertation should contribute new knowledge.
b. The results of a dissertation should be definable and sound.
c. A dissertation should contain material that has applications in nuclear,
plasma, and radiological engineering.
d. A dissertation should be an entity in itself and its essential parts should
be publishable in a refereed journal.
e. A Ph.D. candidate should have demonstrated the ability to carry out
independent research work. 

## After Writing

Prepare to present.
File the preliminary exam document with the department. Consider adding it to
Figshare, Zotero, and the ARFC website.
