This part of the website is intended to be a living document capturing the
norms and processes behind this research group. The following sections were
inspired by [Lab Carpentry](http://labcarpentry.org) and its implementation at
the [Data Exploration Laboratory](https://dxl.ncsa.illinois.edu/) and the 
[Lab for Data Intensive Biology](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/).

# Mission

The **[mission](/manual/mission)** section is a place to state our evolving vision for the safe,
sustainable future of nuclear energy through advanced modeling and simulation
of advanced reactors and fuel cycles.


# Expectations

The section on **[expectations](/manual/expectations)** addresses mutual
expectations among members of the group, with special attention to
student-advisor expectations. Again, a great deal of this section came from
[Lab Carpentry](http://labcarpentry.org) and
[DXL](https://dxl.ncsa.illinois.edu.), but other inspiration also came from
[Chris Blattman](http://chrisblattman.com/graduate-advising/),
[Paul Wilson](http://cnerg.github.io/),
[Carl Boettiger](http://www.carlboettiger.info),
[Titus Brown](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/) and lots of posts on
[the Professor Hacker Blog](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/).

# Code of Conduct

The mutual expectations within the group are built on a foundation of
respect, integrity, and professional conduct. In addition to institutional
standards, this group upholds our own evolving **[code of conduct](/manual/coc)**.

# Guides

**[The guides](/manual/guides/)** are a set of overviews and checklists
for mastering the practical, administrative, and computational infrastructure
ARFC relies on for various common tasks. All research group members should
contribute to this section early and often. If you're new to the research
group, you'll want to use the getting started guide. Additionally, the various channels
through which we communicate both internally and externally are documented in a
set of communication guides. Finally, approaches to productively working with
Katy are captured in some of the guides as well.
