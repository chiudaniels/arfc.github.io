title: Undergraduate Research Assistant Openings
subtitle: "Current openings for undergraduate research assistants."
intro: "Within ARFC, many projects appropriate for undergraduates require a 
significant dedication to learning software skills and best practices. 
Accordingly, we look for undergraduates who are available for at least 10 hours 
a week. We additionally invite undergraduates to join in our group meetings. In 
return for this higher level of participation, we will dedicate the time 
necessary to train you in high-utility computational skills."
